// This example demonstrates soft deleting and hard deleting a stream.
// The example will write an event to a stream then soft delete the stream.
// After this a new event will be written to the soft deleted stream and the
// stream will be undeleted. The stream will then be hard deleted and a subsequent
// request to the stream will be shown to fail.
